# 4.3.5   LAB   How many days: writing and using your own functions
# Your task is to write and test a function which takes two arguments (a year and a month) and returns the number of days for the given year-month pair (while only February is sensitive to the year value, your function should be universal).

# The initial part of the function is ready. Now, convince the function to return None if its arguments don't make sense.

# Of course, you can (and should) use the previously written and tested function (LAB 4.3.1.6). It may be very helpful. We encourage you to use a list filled with the months' lengths. You can create it inside the function â€’ this trick will significantly shorten the code.

# We've prepared a testing code. Expand it to include more test cases.
